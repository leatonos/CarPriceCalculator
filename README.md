# My first React.js project, the Car price simulator

Hello visitor and welcome to my github repo.

At first I did this project using only vanilla javascript. But now I am using React.js and Firestore Database

## Why I did this?

This project was a homework for my mobile app development post-degree course, it was before I learn react.js, so I decided that it would be fun to recriate this project using react

###How can I access this?

Just click on the link below:
